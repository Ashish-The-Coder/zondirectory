            <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the https://www.zondirectory.com website and any other associated Web resources, blockchain resources, and any other associated data or software (the "Service") launched by Cryptozon("us", "we", or "our") or created or posted by software launched by Cryptozon.</p>
            
            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, content posters, sellers, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
            
            <p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Purchases</h3>
            
            <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase") or donate through the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your crypto wallets. We do not collect purchaser’s personal data except of their crypto wallet addresses, purchased items, and the paid sum.</p>
            
            <p>If you wish to remain anonymous, use an anonymous crypto wallet.</p>
            
            <p>While we try to ensure that partial payments don’t happen by doing certain wallet funds amount checks, for Arweave crypto payments it is your responsibility to ensure that your wallet has enough funds to accomplish the entire payment. If the funds in your wallet are not enough, it may happen that the payment happens partially and you do not receive the purchased items. Such partial payments are not disputable, not refundable, and you have no right to receive any compensation for such partial payments.</p>
            
            <p>We are not responsible for files not delivered because of a user closing a page with links to files preliminary or network, browser, desktop, operating system, or other software crashes, hangs, or malfunction.</p>
            
            <h3>No hacking</h3>
            
            <p>You must not use the site, associated blockchain data, or any backend or frontend Service in any other way than through its graphical user interface or an interface providing an equivalent service (what means a service with the same amount of any payments and fees to Publishers and to us). Using the Service in any other way constitutes hacking and can be prosecuted.</p>
            
            <h3>No share of links</h3>
            
            <p>You must not obtain in any other way than by using the frontend provided by us or distribute the links to files provided by the Service, except if a file license explicitly permits this.</p>
            
            <h3>Content</h3>
            
            <p>Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, software, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content. You are obliged not to post content violating any law, license, copyright, trademark, or contract.</p>
            
            <p>You must not post or vote for irrelevant Content (“Spam”) for any part of the service. Particularly you must not post or vote for irrelevant Content for any particular category in our categorization system.</p>
            
            <p>You understand that due to the use of blockchain technology, removal of posted content is not possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>
            
            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Cryptozon.</p>
            
            <p>Cryptozon has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services.

            <h3>No responsibility for acts of user</h3>
            
            <p>Because the service is completely automated, uses blockchain which is not after our control after the launch, and we have no means to control user behavior, we are not responsible for illegal, defamatory, immoral, spammy or any other inappropriate acts of our users or files and links posted by them.</p>
            
            <h3>Our fee</h3>
            
            <p>We change a fee from all purchases and donations. Currently the fee is 10% but can be changed at any time.</p>
            
            <h3>No protection of content publishers rights</h3>
            
            <p>The content publishers using this service must agree that they are solely responsible for protecting their publisher rights and we have no obligation to protect their copyrights, licenses, or any other rights.</p>
            
            <p>Content publishers further agree that a link to their published files becomes persistently available through an irreversible blockchain and we have no mean to physically protect them from illegal downloads.</p>
            
            <h3>License</h3>
            
            <p>Some of our software is licensed under Affero General Public License.</p>
            
            <p>While you have the right to create derivative works of this software (conforming to the license) to upload some files on your own or to allow others to upload files under any terms of your choice, this does not give you the right to violate these terms for any files uploaded by using the Service. These terms don’t apply to derivative works but do apply to files uploaded through the Service, both for using this Service and its derivative works, or any other means to access the Service.</p>
            
            <h3>No responsibility</h3>
            
            <p>We are not responsible for any funds lost, private data disclosed, not delivered items during use of the Service or any malfunction of the Service.</p>
            
            <p>Particularly we are not responsible for any third party hijacking our service.</p>
            
            <h3>Changes</h3>
